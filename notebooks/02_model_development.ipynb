    "## Model Development for Total Household Deposits\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the model development process for forecasting total household deposits. The forecasting pipeline combines an **AutoETS base forecaster** with a **residual boosting model** using **Gradient Boosting Regression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **AutoETS model** is a time series forecaster that automatically selects the best configuration of exponential smoothing (ETS) components — error, trend, and seasonality. It captures the primary linear, seasonal, and trend-driven structure of the time series. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: AutoETS is used instead of manually specifying ETS components as it automatically selects the best combination of Trend, Seasonality and Error using AICc. It provides a robust, consistent and interpretable baseline across time so that the residual booster can focus purely on what ETS can't explain and is relatively immune to overfitting*\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that household deposits exhibit strong linear, non-stationary and seasonal patterns, AutoETS serves as the ideal base model for capturing these dominant patterns. \n",
    "However, to enhance the forecast and capture **nonlinear relationships** or **exogenous effects** not explained by the base model, a **Gradient Boosting model is trained on the residuals** (errors) from the AutoETS forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two-stage modeling approach is designed to combine the strengths of statistical forecasting and machine learning.  \n",
    "The development process consists of two key stages:  \n",
    "- **SHAP-Based Feature selection** using average SHAP importance across cross-validation folds, applied to the residual boosting model.  \n",
    "- **Hyperparameter tuning** of the Gradient Boosting regressor to optimize residual learning performance.\n"

    "To select the most predictive features for the residual component of the AutoETS + Gradient Boosting pipeline, a cross-validated SHAP-based feature selection procedure was implemented. The gradient booster for residual boosting is trained to learn and correct the residuals (forecast errors) produced by the AutoETS model.\n",

    "\n",
    "- A base AutoETS model is fit on a sub-window to forecast household deposits *h* months ahead.\n",

    "- These residuals are treated as the target for a Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), which is trained on exogenous features including lagged and rolling statistics.\n",

These are averaged to determine the most consistently important features across time, and the top-ranked variables are selected for use in each horizon-specific forecast model. This method ensures that selected features are not only predictive but also temporally robust, capturing consistent patterns in forecast errors across time."

    "**A note on AutoETS parameters**:  \n",
    "AutoETS automatically selects the optimal combination of error, trend, and seasonality components based on the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), making it highly adaptive to changes in the underlying temporal structure of the data. Unlike manually specifying a fixed ETS configuration — which may be more appropriate for stable and predictable time series — AutoETS dynamically re-evaluates and adjusts its components (e.g., from additive to damped trends, or seasonal to non-seasonal) as new data becomes available. This adaptability is particularly valuable in real-world forecasting, where patterns can evolve over time due to economic shocks, policy interventions, or structural changes. As a result, AutoETS offers a more flexible and scalable solution for time series modeling in dynamic environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key assumption in this pipeline is that AutoETS will always return the best-fitting ETS structure given the available data at each point in time — effectively capturing the components that are explainable by traditional time series decomposition. This allows the **residual Gradient Boosting model** to focus on learning any remaining nonlinear patterns or relationships driven by exogenous variables that AutoETS cannot account for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation further reinforces this setup: with 10 folds and a 6-month step length, the model evaluates a range of data windows — each potentially resulting in different AutoETS configurations. This variability exposes the boosting model to a diverse set of residual patterns, strengthening its ability to generalize and complement the base model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only manually specified parameter for AutoETS is the **seasonal periodicity (`sp`)**, which defines the recurring seasonal cycle. For monthly data, `sp=12` captures annual seasonality, while `sp=4` would be appropriate for quarterly data.  \n",
    "Exploratory analysis (see below) confirms a strong and stable annual pattern in household deposits, justifying the choice of `sp=12`.\n",
